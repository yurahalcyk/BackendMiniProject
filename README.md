# BackendMiniProject
Backend mini project in which I've attempted to create 3 entities: student, course and enrolled.

I've attempted to keep student and course as separate entities, and was hoping use the entity enroll to connect the two - addEnrolment operation to use student id and course id to create an enrolment. (using @onetoone)

However, I couldn't figure this out in the time given.

Instead, to add an enrolment you have to manually type in student ID and course ID and I've added a check to see that both ID's exist in their respective databases.

I look forward to improving this in the future when I develop more knowledge about database relationships.
