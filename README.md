# BackendMiniProject
Backend mini project in which I've attempted to create 3 entities: student, course and enrolled.
I've attempted to keep student and course as separate entities, and was hoping use the entity enroll to connect the two - addEnrolment operation to use student id and course id to create an enrolment.

- Issue -> I cant seem to figure out how to make this enrolment entity work the way i want it too -> work in progress
